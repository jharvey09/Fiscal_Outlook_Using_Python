### Background
For the first time, it's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. In this project, I have the assignment to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company.  Welcome to my introduction to  Python! More of a less complicated project, being that this was my introduction to the world of programming.  I had a set of data that I needed to report. Such as ***"What was the total number of months included in the dataPrint the number of months?"*** Also, I needed to look at ***"What was the net-total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period?"*** With that, I can then conclude ***"What are the average changes in the Profit/Losses over the entire period?***  Also, I can see "What was the greatest increase in profits (data and amount) over the entire period?"***

### Steps
1. Read data file
2. Import dataconversion libraries 
3. Create import lists for the CSV data
4. Convert string date to datetime
5. Extract year and month from datetime column
6. Create month - years pairs Print header

### Summary:
In my analysis, I was able to find that there were a total of *86 months* included in the *datasetPrint*. The data also shows that the net-total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period was *$38,382,578*. The average change in the Profit/Losses was calcualted at *$-2,315.12*. The month with the greatest increae to date was *February 2012 with a whopping $1,926,159 in total profits*. The greatest loss in profits was on *September 2013, they took a major hit with a lost of $-2,196,167*.

#### Sales Anlaysis Summary:
**Complete analysis of sales report summarized:** My analysis was that, after running the data and completing some simulations. It was determined that the company lost shy of $1,500 in total when weighing out the average.
